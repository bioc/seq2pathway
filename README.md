# seq2pathway
Seq2pathway can be used to seach for enriched functional pre-defined gene-sets (at pathway level), using variable next-generation sequencing data (rather than gene lists).
Integral to this tool are the 'seq2gene' and 'gene2pathway' components in series that infer a quantitative pathway profiles for each sample.
